The challenge:
Create a simple full-stack application using ReactJS or AngularJS and Java to handle a single page
application showing the weather forecast of a random City. The app should have button to
refresh the location picking the coordinates randomly and consequent refresh of the app
should never show the same City twice. So the backend should implement a mechanism to
store the previously shown records.

Mockup:
The web app should communicate with the APIs of the Backend via REST APIs 
APIs and the Backend should fetch the records for the next 5 days from
https://openweathermap.org/forecast5
* The initially shown City should be Berlin.
* The app should load a graph showing the trend of the temperature in the next 5 days
Requirements:
* Requested browser compatibility: current versions of Chrome, FF, Safari
* You may split up the main component of the ReactJs app in as many sub-components as
you see fit, using Redux is recommended but not necessary.
* The app should be tested as much as possible
* Think of it as a component that will end up in a large, scalable react app. Consider this
when writing HTML and CSS as well.
* You're free to use as many third party JS and PHP libraries that may fit
* You're free to use any build tools that you like (including CSS pre/post-processors). Do
not focus on the tooling though.


* Use proper semantics when writing HTML (for example: the book list has to be a `<ul>`
and all the children just `<li>` elements)
* Create a git repository with an appropriate number of commits with a descriptive message
for each of them (commit as often as you can)
* Will be great if the commit for the tests could come before the actual code so that it is
clear how the app was built and thought from the beginning till the end result
A README file should be included with instructions about the details, design and tool
chosen for the development and of course instructions about how to run and test the app.
