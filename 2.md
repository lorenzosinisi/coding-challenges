# TwitFlow

Using a service fetch tweets from the Twitter Streaming APIs and sends data to the console if they match a regex.

`[A] -> [B] -> [C]`

That means:


A takes the tweets from the streem
B checks if the tweet matches a regex
C prints them to console

The code should be configurable in terms of how many tweets per seconds are logged and which word is tracked.

Would be interesting to use something like this library in Java to consume the APIs https://github.com/twitter/hbc

* Use proper semantics when writing Java and JS code (for example: the book list has to be a `<ul>`
and all the children just `<li>` elements)
* Create a git repository with an appropriate number of commits with a descriptive message
for each of them (commit as often as you can)
* Will be great if the commit for the tests could come before the actual code so that itu is
clear how the app was built and thought from the beginning till the end result
A README file should be included with instructions about the details, design and tool
chosen for the development and of course instructions about how to run and test the app.
